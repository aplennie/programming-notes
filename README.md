# Programming Notes

I seriously don't remember anything unless I write it down. This repository helps with that! ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜Ž These are all notes I've taken while learning some concept, sometimes from readings/blogs, mostly from online courses. If you see anything that could be improved [submit an issue](https://github.com/leeandher/programming-notes/issues), and I'll try to fix it up.
