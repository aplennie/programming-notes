## Git Design
working -> staging -> commit
git init
- start a repository.
git status
- see all tracked/untracked files
git add
 - stage a file
git diff
 - compare working files to previous versions
git commit
- create a commit
git log
 - show complete commit history to this branch
git show HEAD
- show log changes for current commit, as well as diff
