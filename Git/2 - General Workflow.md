# W.I.P. NOTE

## Git Design

### Understanding the Workflow
Git uses three areas in tandem to track, prepare and backup your files with a full history. They are as follows: the _working_ area, _staging_ area, _commit_ area. Each area functions differently and requires different commands to change the data with in them.
 - __Working Directory__

 The _Working Directory_ is where your backed-up files will reside. They form the _repository_ which is used.
 - __Staging Area__
 - __Commit__



##### _NOTES TO FORMALIZE_
working -> staging -> commit
- git init
 - start a repository.
- git status
 - see all tracked/untracked files
- git add
 - stage a file
- git diff
 - compare working files to previous versions
- git commit
 - create a commit
- git log
 - show complete commit history to this branch
- git show HEAD
 - show log changes for current commit, as well as diff
