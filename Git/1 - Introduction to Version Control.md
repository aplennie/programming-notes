## What is Version Control?

### Definition

Version control is a system which records additions, deletions and changes to a file (or set of files) so that they can be referred to later on. This will allow users to revert working files to previous versions or even check out a complete older version of an existing project. Having access to a complete change history allows for complete traceability in case something goes wrong, and an old version must be restored, compared or referred to.

### Types of Version Control Systems

 - __Local Version Control__

 This is the most common type of version control for most people. If they have a project they're working on (code-related or not), just making another directory to store all the related files is a very simple solution. While it's organized, it is also very error prone by deleting or copying over necessary files.

 - __Centralized Version Control__

 Centralized Version Control is largely used when collaborating with a team (especially for programming). Since team members may require access to shared data/files, using a centralized source server to contain and checkout all the working files is definitely viable. It may even allow for supervision of exactly which files/projects other team members are working on; however, the obvious risk is that entire project bases can easily be lost through server failure, weak security or physical damage.

 - __Distributed Version Control__
