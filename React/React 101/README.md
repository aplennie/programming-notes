# React 101

This is a collection of notes I compiled from the [React 101, Course, Parts I and II](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/react-101) offered by [Codecademy](codecademy.com)!

Feel free to look through and learn, and if anything confusing (or blatently wrong, since I was learning at the time too), please just send me a message or make a PR.

Thanks!
